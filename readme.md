# Hello, I'm Riley

## I am a Front End Developer/Engineer who lives in Portland, OR with my fiance and gang of cats.

## Status
 I am currently looking for a new role, based in Portland, OR or remotely, as a Front End Engineer/Developer, ideally utilizing React in some way. Let's Connect on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/riley-cravens/)!

 ## At Work
 I have worked for [LeadVenture](https://www.leadventure.com/) as a Front End Developer since August 2018. Before that I attended Portland Community College, from which I hold an Associate's of Applied Science in Web Development.
 ### Lately at LeadVenture:
 + Worked 100% remotely since March due to Covid-19, ~~I really miss my sit/stand desk~~ I love my new home office sit/stand desk
 + Led the Front End Development department in multiple OEM product initiatives for companies such as BRP, ROXOR, Piaggio ,and Kubota
 + These products feature dynamic multi-language support via a data-driven HandlebarsJS/Node web application
 + Led team trainings on HandlebarsJs and Git/Azure DevOps workflows

 ## At Home
 I have been working on courses and side projects with ES6+ and React/Gatsby/Node since mid 2019 and would love to do so full time. I first learned React, Express, Node and MongoDB  to create a site for my [upcoming wedding](https://www.rileyandjessica.com/) ~~9/6/2020 damn you covid!~~ 9/5/2021 and intend to rebuild it using Gatsby soon. I have done a limited amount of freelance work and generally try to keep that minimal, but I can often be found doing work for friends and family.
