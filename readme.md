# Hello, I'm Riley

## I am a Front End Developer who lives in Portland, OR.

## Status
 I am currently looking for a new role, either based in Portland or fully remote(or a blend of both), as a Front End Developer, ideally utilizing React in some way. Let's Connect on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/riley-cravens/)!

 ## At Work
 I have worked for [LeadVenture](https://www.leadventure.com/) as a Front End Developer since August 2018. Before that I attended Portland Community College, from which I hold an Associate's of Applied Science in Web Development.
 ### Lately at LeadVenture
 + Worked 100% remotely since March 2020 and don't expect to return to the office
 + Led the UI Development of a Branded Zone product for companies such as BMW, Royal Enfield, BRP, Kubota, and Piaggio
 + The tech stack includes Vue/Nuxt and TypeScript fed from Squidex
 + Led team trainings on Vue and TypeScript and Git, Jira and Azure DevOps workflows

 ## At Home
 Lately, I have been working on courses and side projects with React/Next/Gatsby and would love to do so full time. I used Gatsby to build a site for my [upcoming wedding](https://www.rileyandjessica.com/) ~~9/6/2020 thanks covid!~~ ~~9/5/2021 thanks again covid!~~ 8/28/2022 and plan to rebuild it with Next to add an e-commerce style Honeymoon registry this year.
